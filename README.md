# K-Means-Clustering
The objective here is to implement the K-Means clustering using two different strategies and analyze them.
* Strategy 1: randomly pick the initial centers from the given samples.

* Strategy 2: pick the first center randomly; for the i-th center (i>1), choose a sample (among all possible samples) such that the average distance of this chosen one to all previous (i-1) centers is maximal.
